# TODO

1. ~~Make a dummy API using Google's CLI to ship action scripts to the Google Sheet itself.~~
2. ~~Figure out how to do Google Authorization on the frontend.~~
  ~~1. Check if it's possible to send emails to random emails via GAS.~~
3. Make a small HTML page and deploy it on GitHub.
4. ~~Make a request that shows the initial dummy data stored in the Google Sheet.~~
5. ~~Figure out how to do different environments.~~
6. Separate the sheet and the Google Apps Script.
7. Make automated tests with Postman.
8. Think how to make the URL of the API permanent.

At some point an ASL should be created to map the Google Sheet data arrays to TS interfaces.
