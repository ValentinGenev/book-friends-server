# Clasp usage

**IMPORTANT** The order in which the scripts are pushed to the Google Editor is very important. See: [filepushorder](https://github.com/google/clasp?tab=readme-ov-file#filepushorder-optional).

Read more about Clasp's usage on the [official documentation](https://github.com/google/clasp)
